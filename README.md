In the recent past, measurement of coverage has been mainly through
two-stage cluster sampled surveys either as part of a nutrition
assessment or through a specific coverage survey known as Centric
Systematic Area Sampling (CSAS). However, such methods are resource
intensive and often only used for final programme evaluation meaning
results arrive too late for programme adaptation. SQUEAC, which stands
for Semi-Quantitative Evaluation of Access and Coverage, is a low
resource method designed specifically to address this limitation and is
used regularly for monitoring, planning and importantly, timely
improvement to programme quality, both for agency and Ministry of Health
(MoH) led programmes. This package provides functions for use in
conducting a SQUEAC investigation.

## Installation

The `squeacr` package is not yet available on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org).

The `squeacr` package provides functions that facilitate the processing,
analysis and reporting of various components of a SQUEAC investigation.
The current version of the `squeacr` package currently provides the
following:

- Functions to calculate CMAM programme performance metrics;

- Functions to calculate CMAM programme length of stay metrics; and,

- Functions to calculate CMAM coverage estimates.
