\title{Semi-Quantitative Evaluation of Access and Coverage (SQUEAC) Tools in R}
\description{
In the recent past, measurement of coverage has been mainly through
two-stage cluster sampled surveys either as part of a nutrition assessment
or through a specific coverage survey known as Centric Systematic Area
Sampling (CSAS). However, such methods are resource intensive and often only
used for final programme evaluation meaning results arrive too late for
programme adaptation. SQUEAC, which stands for Semi-Quantitative Evaluation
of Access and Coverage, is a low resource method designed specifically to
address this limitation and is used regularly for monitoring, planning and
importantly, timely improvement to programme quality, both for agency and
Ministry of Health (MoH) led programmes. This package provides functions
for use in conducting a SQUEAC investigation.
