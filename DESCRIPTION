Description: In the recent past, measurement of coverage has been mainly through 
    two-stage cluster sampled surveys either as part of a nutrition assessment 
    or through a specific coverage survey known as Centric Systematic Area 
    Sampling (CSAS). However, such methods are resource intensive and often only 
    used for final programme evaluation meaning results arrive too late for 
    programme adaptation. SQUEAC, which stands for Semi-Quantitative Evaluation 
    of Access and Coverage, is a low resource method designed specifically to 
    address this limitation and is used regularly for monitoring, planning and 
    importantly, timely improvement to programme quality, both for agency and 
    Ministry of Health (MoH) led programmes. This package provides functions
    for use in conducting a SQUEAC investigation.
